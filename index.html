                <p>
                    Everyone’s life is a different story. Some of us experience a lot of good happenings in life where other ones experience the exact opposite. But it is necessary for anyone to understand the fact that “life is full of joy, sorrow, ecstasy, difficulties, happiness, sorrow, victory, defeat etc.

                <h3>Vision</h3>
                <p>I am currently studying in class 8. I am just going to describe my life in short through words. So, I am living a student life nowadays. Student life is not so easy that everyone gossips about. A student has to manage a sort of things like studies, health, hygiene, friendship, and other duties.</p>

                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>ost people don’t like hurdles and difficulties but I do because they make me a better version of myself after I conquer them. As I have a problem-solving attitude, I like to solve maths. In fact, maths is the perfect example of assessing one’s problem-solving ability.</p>
